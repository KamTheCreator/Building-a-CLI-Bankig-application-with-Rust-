# Banking System Project

## Overview

Welcome to the Banking System project! This is our first Rust project as part of the campaign to empower your developer journey with Rust. In this project, we'll explore setting up a Rust project using Cargo, Rust's package manager.

## Step 1: Exploring the Ecosystem with crates.io

Rust's central registry for community projects is [crates.io](https://crates.io/). Here, you can find and publish crates, explore various projects, and get valuable information and statistics.

## Step 2: Installing Cargo with Rustup

To manage Rust installations and tools, we use `rustup`. If you haven't installed it yet, head to [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/) and follow the instructions provided. Make sure to choose the appropriate installer for your operating system.

If you're using Windows for productivity but prefer developing on Linux, you can utilize Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) by following the instructions [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install). Then, proceed with the installation of `rustup` within your WSL instance.

## Step 3: Cargo as a Package Manager

Cargo simplifies the process of building, testing, and managing Rust software dependencies. Key commands include:

- `cargo build`: Compiles your project with debug symbols by default. Use `--release` flag for fully optimized builds.
- `cargo test`: Executes all unit tests within your project.
  
Testing is crucial for ensuring code quality, reliability, and stability. It helps identify bugs early, provides a safety net for code changes, and encourages better code design.

## Step 4: Installing Cool Tools with Cargo

Cargo's `install` subcommand allows you to install binaries from projects. For example, you can install `bat`, a tool for inspecting file contents with syntax highlighting, using `cargo install bat`. Ensure that `CARGO_HOME/bin` is included in your PATH (or Path for Windows) to seamlessly use installed tools.

## Step 5: Project Management with Cargo and Initializing Our Banking System Project

Let's initialize our Banking System project by running:

```
cargo new banking-system
```

This command sets up a new Rust project with default layout. The project structure includes a `Cargo.toml` file, source code files, and directories for tests and dependencies. Running Cargo commands like `build` or `test` in the project's root directory will create necessary build artifacts and cache data.

### Project Structure

Our project follows a traditional layout:

- `src/`: Contains source code files (`main.rs` for binary projects).
- `Cargo.toml`: Specifies project metadata and dependencies.
- `Cargo.lock`: Captures dependency information for reproducibility.
- `target/`: Directory for cached build data.

## Conclusion

With Cargo and Rust, we're equipped to develop our Banking System project efficiently. Let's dive into Rust programming and build something amazing! ðŸš€
